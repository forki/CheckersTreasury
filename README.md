# Checkers
This is a project that I am doing for credit in school.  Code reviews and bug reports are welcome, but all PRs will be rejected until May 1st, 2017.

## Playing
First, clone and build this repo with the `https://github.com/Hosch250/Checkers.git` URI.  Then, clone, build, and deploy the UI repo with the `https://github.com/Hosch250/CheckersUI.git` URI.  Windows 10 Anniversary Update must be installed for this app to build.

## Using in Other Programs
This project is designed to be a standalone Checkers library, featuring (eventually) multiple variants, a fast AI (working on it!), and generally full support for anything you want to use a Checkers library for.

### Licensing
This library is licensed under [Apache 2.0](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/apache-2.0/), so be sure to follow the terms of use.

**TLDR:** You can freely change the source and use it in commercial programs, you must credit my work, and this software does not contain any warranty and you must not hold me liable for any problems caused by it.
